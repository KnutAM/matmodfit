abstract = {Using an Axial-Torsion testing machine, pearlitic R260 steel specimens are twisted until fracture under different axial loads. A well established framework for finite elastoplasticity with kinematic hardening is used to model the deformation of the specimens. In particular, we evaluate the ability of different kinematic hardening laws to predict the observed biaxial load versus displacement response. It is found that the combination of Armstrong-Frederick dynamic recovery and Burlet-Cailletaud radial evanescence saturation is efficient even for the large strains achieved in this study. The results are less conclusive on the appropriateness of replacing the Armstrong-Frederick with an Ohno-Wang type of kinematic hardening law.},
